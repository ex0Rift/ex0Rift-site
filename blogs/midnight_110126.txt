<h2>My experience at midnight!</h2>

Firstly, wow! What an experience and a half. it was increadible, meeting new people, expereining new wonderful places.
I couldnt of asked for a better time with better people.

<h3 style="padding-left:15px;">The location</h3>

Being in the heart of Vienna, Austria is amazing. it is a buetiful place with so muhc culture. The buildings are rich with histroy
and the palaces, Cathedrals and vast buildngs are beutiful, everywhere you turn there are new amazing sights to see. Notably at Resselpark
The Rhitecture of the Church was amazing, like i was being towerd over by a monolyth.
<br><br>
Secondly the transport! somthing often glazed over, but it stood out to me especially living in rural Uk where transport is absoluty shocking
and non existant. Like trains getting you across the whole city in five minuites, and they are every five minuites all day? Then trams connecting
these trains together and even further busses. WOW! The fact all of this is put together and so cheap, it makes exploring so easy and fast
with the least amount of hastle and cost possible. Literally was perfct and allowed some great indipendance.

The sense of community and excitment was amazing, the vibe of the venue on point and projects made where fun cherful and exciting.
I had made so many new friends form so many cultures and background and learnt so much from these great, fun and wonderful people, it really
felt life changing. So many people with different methods of learning and creating having fun. Especially our karaoke nights!
<br><br>
The skills i learnt from other people is priceless, people know so much and I saw the amount of oportunity that is ahead of me; its incredible
and vast. It really tought me more about what i need to know to extend my skill and programming knowlade forward.
